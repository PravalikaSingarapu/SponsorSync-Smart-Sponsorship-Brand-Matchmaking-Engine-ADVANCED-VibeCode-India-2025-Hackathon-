“We’re building SponsorSync, a smart sponsorship matchmaking engine integrated into EventEye, to solve a common gap — student organizers struggle to find sponsors, and brands miss out on highly targeted event exposure. With SponsorSync, clubs can build sponsor-ready profiles showcasing audience size, past reach, and engagement data.

**SponsorSync** is a smart matchmaking platform that connects student event organizers with the right sponsors. It empowers student clubs to create sponsor-ready event profiles and enables sponsors to filter opportunities that align with their brand’s goals, audience, and marketing strategies.
